# Macroeconomic-Analysis
The Impact of Interest Rate Changes on Inflation and GDP Growth in US
This project presents an in-depth analysis of the macroeconomic impact of key financial indicators—primarily interest rates, inflation rates, and real GDP growth—through the application of data-driven statistical and machine learning methodologies. The purpose of the study is to uncover patterns, assess relationships among variables, and predict future trends using historical economic data. The analytical framework is built to support robust economic policy evaluation and strategic decision-making for financial planning and macroeconomic forecasting.

The study begins with a thorough exploration of the time series behavior of core macroeconomic indicators. Visual tools such as line plots and correlation heatmaps provide an initial understanding of data trends, volatility, and potential interdependencies. Notably, the time series plots reveal cyclicality in GDP growth, inflation, and interest rates, hinting at economic patterns shaped by policy interventions, external shocks, and cyclical behavior of markets.

Correlation analysis is employed to quantify the strength and direction of relationships between variables. For example, the project highlights a moderate to strong negative correlation between interest rates and real GDP growth, suggesting that as interest rates rise, economic growth tends to slow—a pattern consistent with monetary policy expectations. Additionally, a positive correlation between inflation and interest rates underscores the reactive nature of central banks to inflationary pressure. These correlations are visually represented using scatter plots and heatmaps, reinforcing the statistical relationships with visual evidence.

A rolling correlation technique is used to observe how the relationship between interest rates and GDP growth evolves over time. This dynamic view of correlation is essential for macroeconomic analysis, as the strength and direction of relationships can shift across different economic regimes. The analysis reveals periods of heightened sensitivity, such as during financial crises or monetary tightening phases, where interest rates exert stronger influence on GDP.

To enhance predictive power, the study applies multiple regression models and machine learning algorithms. These models are evaluated based on accuracy metrics like R-squared values, mean squared error, and visual alignment between actual and predicted GDP growth. The project demonstrates how combining domain knowledge with advanced analytics can lead to high-performing, interpretable models. A significant insight here is the effectiveness of multivariate models in capturing the combined effect of inflation and interest rates on GDP, which performs better than univariate models.

In addition to statistical rigor, the project emphasizes visual storytelling. Figures such as “Actual vs. Predicted Real GDP Growth” and “Scatter Plot of Interest Rate vs. Inflation Rate” not only illustrate quantitative findings but also enhance communication of complex relationships in a simple, accessible format. This visual layer is crucial for policy analysts, economists, and stakeholders who rely on intuitive representations for decision-making.

The final section of the study, “Detailed Summary of Analytical Insights,” distills key takeaways from each stage of the analysis. These include confirmation of expected economic theory relationships, identification of anomalies, and implications for interest rate policy and inflation targeting. The summary section underscores how data can guide interpretation of economic signals and policy responsiveness.

Overall, the project exemplifies how blending traditional econometric techniques with modern machine learning and data visualization tools can significantly elevate macroeconomic impact assessment. It provides a solid foundation for future research, real-time forecasting systems, and interactive economic dashboards. With strong analytical grounding and practical insights, the study equips financial professionals, policymakers, and researchers with a comprehensive toolkit to better understand and respond to shifting economic landscapes.
